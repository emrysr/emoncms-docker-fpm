# install docker on a raspberry pi
tested on rpi3b+ on ethernet

will run all the required emoncms components within docker containers
host system reboots trigged by ~/.host-shutdown-interface.sh

## install instructions
- download latest raspian lite image and burn to sd card
- login via ssh to install git
- run ./install.sh to install docker and the containers
done

TLDR;
------------------

## From your laptop:
- download the official raspibian buster lite [I'm using 2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.zip](magnet:?xt=urn:btih:2213f24bca4031663b3dfa99fb554dce8cfcb5da&dn=2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.zip&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.raspberrypi.org%3A6969%2Fannounce)
- burn image to micro sd card using Etcher
- once completed (7mins for me), remove and re-insert sd card
- put empty file onto /boot partition named `ssh` to enable headless remote access
- unmount the sd card (eject/sefely remove) and put it into the raspberry pi
- turn on the raspberry pi
- get the new ip - try the fing app or the nmap command (eg. `nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24`) to see list of devices
- login via ssh `$ ssh pi@192.168.1.[0-254]` into a terminal window

## From the Raspberry Pi
login remotly with ssh...
`ssh pi@[your pi's ip address]`

# get the files on the device
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git-core
```

all the commands have been put into a bash script. clone the git repo and run the install script...
## copy files from github
```
git clone https://github.com/emrysr/emoncms-docker-fpm.git && cd emoncms-docker-fpm
```

(during development use this branch)
```
git checkout -b stage1-5-emonhub && git pull origin stage1-5-emonhub && git pull origin stage1-5-emonhub
```

## run install
```
$ ./install.sh 
```

## shutdown controller
to enable docker container to reboot host, create volume on container that maps to the file /var/run/shutdown_signal. if the contents of this file is changed to "reboot" then the command `sudo shutdown -r now` is triggerd

-----------
TODO: test and finish this
## install instructions on laptop
 - just git clone the repo
 - edit .env and correct WEB_PORT to an acceptable number
 - edit .env to MYSQL_DOCKER_IMAGE to mariadb:latest (not supported by arm v7)
 - run docker-compse up in the emoncms-docker directory
